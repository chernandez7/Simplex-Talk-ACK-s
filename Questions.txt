If a client stops and is restarted, it will resume with message_id = 1. Can this be a problem?
	Theoretically it can be a problem because it can cause the program to deadlock. It will always be waiting for ACK[N] but the program will be sending it as ACK[N+1].

Any packet coming back from the server can be assumed to be an acknowledgement. Are there any potential problems with this assumption?
	Not really. It should always be acknowledgements but you can't always assume that it will always be the corresponding acknowledgement. For example in the old duplicate problem it may be a previous acknowledgement from another connection.

Will this acknowledgement version of the protocol work through a NAT firewall?
	A NAT firewall blocks all unrequested inbound traffic, since the ACK isn't explicitly requested then it will not work trhough a NAT firewall.
